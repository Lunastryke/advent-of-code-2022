Doing this challenge in Python and maybe Golang to improve my programming skills

## Reflections

- Day 1
  - Part 1 was simple, O(N) TC, one pass through array
  - Part 2 slightly harder, called a sort() each time i inserted element into list of size 3. Since list is constant time sort is essentially O(1). Probably can be implemented better with a min heap.
- Day 2
  - Parts 1 and 2 were pretty straightforward. ord() to convert string to ascii values, dict to simplify the win and lose pattern mappings
- Day 3
